# Mini-alexa
## Like Alexa, you can give input to the system via voice. Similarly, in this you can give the command via voice and it will perform several tasks based on your command.
In this python file, I have imported some libraries: 
   ## speech_recognition
   ##  pyttsx3, pywhatkit (for access youtube functions)
   ##  datetime
   ##  wikipedia
   ##  pyjokes
   ##  cv2
   ##  time
First of all, it will take command via listen the source and then recognize that source. After that if 'alexa' word will found in the command then it will perform the several tasks otherwise it will again listen the command.
The following are the tasks:
## Task 1: Play the youtube song
  if 'play' will present in command then it will play the song on youtube.
## Task 2: Show the present time using datetime.datetime.now() fucntion
## Task 3: Tell about someone using wikipedia module
## Task 4: Tell you joke using pyjoke module
## Task 5: Open smile detection program
## Task 6: Exit the program using exit() command and many more small tasks

So these are the various tasks which will perform by this program.
I hope you like this
